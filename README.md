# Pokemon App

## About

This is a simple Pokédex App built with HTML, CSS and Javascript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. When a Pokemon's name is clicked, the image, type, height and weight characteristics of the Pokemon appears on a modal. Alternatively, pokemons can be searched by typing the pokemon name in the search bar. This modal can then be closed by clicking on the close (x) button, pressing the escape key or clicking outside the modal.

## Dependencies I used for the App

- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Pokémon API
- Ajax
